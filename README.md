# TicTacToe
Hello, I have created this game as a project for my college (semester 5) as a beginner to web development and design. I have not used internet to solve any problem, just try and error. Human vs Human mode is easy, but when I tried to write code for Human vs Computer mode, I failed many times, and sometimes I was doing well for some ticks but then even I can't understand my own code! But after wasting some papers, playing the game against my self, I found a general method to win any game (not really how to win, but atleast...). And game is here. (Please, don't copy my algorithms!)
